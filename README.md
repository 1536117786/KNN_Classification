# KNN Classification Model using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a classification model using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a real dataset.

📌 **Project Overview**  
The goal is to classify data into predefined categories using the KNN algorithm. The notebook walks through the full machine learning pipeline—from loading the dataset to evaluating the model's performance.

🧰 **Tools & Libraries Used**
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

⚙️ **Workflow**

**1. Import Libraries**  
Essential Python libraries are imported for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

**2. Data Loading**  
The dataset is loaded from a `.csv` file using pandas. Ensure the dataset is in the working directory or provide the correct path.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Structure of the dataset  
- Checking for missing values  
- Summary statistics and distributions  
- Visualization using matplotlib  

**4. Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values (if any)  
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  

**5. Model Building**  
- Training the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier using `KNeighborsClassifier` from scikit-learn

**6. Model Evaluation**  
Evaluation of model performance using:  
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  

✅ **Results**  
The model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics are used to assess performance. Based on the results, KNN shows how well it can classify new data after preprocessing.

📊 **Future Work**
- Apply cross-validation to improve model robustness  
- Experiment with different values of K  
- Compare KNN with other classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest  
- Try dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to improve performance
